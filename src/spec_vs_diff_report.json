  "summary": "The implementation successfully adds local file import functionality to the ScanPage with a new FileImport component. All four requirements (REQ-9, REQ-10, REQ-11, REQ-12) are implemented. The file input supports JPEG, PNG, and WebP formats, processes imported files through the same workflow as camera captures (including ImageEditor), updates ScanPage state management to handle both input modes via tabs, and provides clear UI affordances with a tabbed interface showing Camera and Import File options. No missing requirements or hallucinated features detected.",
